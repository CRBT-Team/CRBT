# CRBT - Privacy Policy
 _Last update: 2021-07-02 (10.0)_

When you make use of the CRBT service, by adding it to a server or by using it as a Discord user, you automatically apply to this privacy policy.

## Your privacy controls

CRBT offers a simple toggle between two telemetry modes: "Minimal" and "Complete". By default, the Complete mode is enabled. To change it to Minimal, you can simply execute the `()telemetry` command. This will allow you to review a part of your collected data along with information on how to manage it. If you wish to entirely delete saved data about you, you can always [send me an email](mailto:clembs@clembs.xyz).

## How your data is used

I do __not__ sell, share or give your data. This data is only accessible by me, Clembs, the creator and main developer of CRBT. I use this data to understand how anyone use CRBT to improve on its fluency, its ease of use and what commands are more used than other to improve them. If Complete mode is enabled, I will also use the user ID to track potential abusers and breach-exploiters. Note that this data is logged through messages sent into a private Discord server that only I and CRBT can access.

## Minimal mode: What I collect

If minimal mode is enabled (through the `()telemetry` command), I only collect the command name of whatever command is used.
Note that minimal mode is not active by default.

## Complete mode: What I collect

As said earlier, the Complete mode is enabled by default and will log more data, including:
- The command name + the arguments (what come after the command name)
- Where the command was executed (DMs/Server)
- Your user ID
- The platform (Desktop/Mobile/Web)
